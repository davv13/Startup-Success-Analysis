# Startup-Success-Analysis

### Let's dive into a dataset of 472 startups to figure out why some succeed and others don't. It's like detective work, but for the business world.

### The primary objective of this analysis is to identify and understand the underlying factors that lead to the success or failure of startup companies. By the implementation of machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis methods, I want to highlight the key indicators of startup outcomes. This is about uncovering the secrets of success for new companies. By figuring this out, I can help future entrepreneurs, investors, and maybe even improve the economy a bit.
